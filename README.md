A project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) where we made a Battleship game using Webpacks, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Cool Features
- Player can play against a Computer that can be kind of difficult to beat!
- Player can place their own ships vertically and horizontally.
- In Player vs. Player mode, between rounds there is a "changing player" screen to prevent cheating.
